Keep in mind I&#x27;m just a tire-kicker on HN, but it would be neat to have dynamic periodic reminders similar to spaced repetition learning algorithms except you rate the strength of the relationship after each session. Strong ratings mean you can see them a little less frequently; weak means you should see them (a little) more frequently.<p>Ideally this would let you maximize the number of maintainable acquaintances.

I have created a sort of structure for things I might to remember about each person (journal of past interactions, contact info, etc etc) that I also use for my dealings with some businesses so I can revisit who said what when, if needed.  And it can auto-provide the structure in for future persons or organizations I add to my contact list, but only when wanted.  Same with anything else I want to track.<p>And it creates a soft of personal journal for me as a side-effect, by exporting everything created (or archived) for date ranges, so my odd random notes fit in also.  It lets you optionally mark things as public or private, export things as .txt outlines or an .html mini-web site, and (hopefully) soon exchange info with others if desired.  Self- or my-hosted.<p>Unfortunately, OM also lacks a nice video and installation is still manual (some postgres config instructions then &quot;java -jar...&quot;) until interest warrants a real installer.  I use it for <i>everything</i> (no mobile support yet) and it is <i>extremely</i> efficient for a touch typist, and easy to learn as everything is on the screen in menus generated context-sensitively on the fly.<p>Many details, download, FAQs and future plans at:  <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemodel.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemodel.org</a>  .\n",
